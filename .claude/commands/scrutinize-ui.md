# Scrutinize UI

Great, now I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.

## Focus Areas

1. **Visual hierarchy** - Is the most important content emphasized?
2. **Spacing & alignment** - Is everything properly aligned with consistent spacing?
3. **Typography** - Are fonts, sizes, and weights appropriate?
4. **Color usage** - Is the color palette consistent and accessible?
5. **Interactions** - Are hover states, transitions, and feedback smooth?
6. **Loading states** - Are loading indicators helpful and non-jarring?
7. **Error states** - Are error messages clear and actionable?
8. **Empty states** - Do empty states guide users appropriately?
9. **Responsiveness** - Does it work well on different screen sizes?
10. **Accessibility** - Is it usable with keyboard and screen readers?
