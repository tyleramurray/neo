# Analyze Beads

Re-read AGENTS.md first. Then, can you try using bv to get some insights on what each agent should most usefully work on?

Then share those insights with the other agents via agent mail and strongly suggest in your messages the optimal work for each one and explain how/why you came up with that using bv.

## Analysis Process

1. Read AGENTS.md for context
2. Run `bv --robot-triage` to analyze beads
3. Consider each agent's:
   - Current workload
   - Expertise areas
   - What they're already working on
4. Assign beads to minimize conflicts
5. Send Agent Mail messages with assignments

## Message Template

When sending work assignments:

```
Subject: Work Assignment - [Bead ID]

Hi [Agent Name],

Based on bv analysis, I suggest you work on:
- Bead: [ID] - [Description]
- Reason: [Why this is a good fit]
- Dependencies: [Any prerequisites]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

Let me know if you have questions!
```

## Coordination Tips

- Avoid assigning overlapping file paths
- Consider task dependencies
- Balance workload across agents
- Reserve files being worked on
