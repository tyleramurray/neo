# Reread Agents

Reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind.

## Why This Matters

AGENTS.md contains critical information about:
- Project coordination rules
- How to use beads (bd) for task tracking
- Agent Mail communication protocols
- Landing the plane (session completion) requirements
- Code standards and conventions

## After Rereading

Confirm you understand:
1. How to claim and close beads
2. When and how to communicate via Agent Mail
3. The mandatory push-before-done rule
4. File reservation protocols
5. Quality standards for the project

## Key Rules Reminder

- Always claim beads before working: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
- Always close beads when done: `bd close <id>`
- Always push before ending: `git push`
- Reserve files you're editing via Agent Mail
- Communicate significant changes to other agents
