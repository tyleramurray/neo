ENTERING RESEARCH MODE

Your task: Investigate and understand. DO NOT write or modify any code.

1. Read the relevant files for: $ARGUMENTS
2. Check docs/architecture.md for system context
3. Check docs/decisions.md for active patterns on this area
4. Summarize your findings:
   - Current state
   - How it works
   - Potential concerns
   - Questions that need answering

Remember: Research mode is READ ONLY. No code changes.

---
When research is complete, next steps:
- /innovate [topic] - Brainstorm approaches based on findings
- /plan [feature] - Skip to planning if approach is clear
