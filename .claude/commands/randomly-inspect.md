# Randomly Inspect

I want you to sort of randomly explore the code files in this project, choosing code files to deeply investigate and understand and trace their functionality and execution flows through the related code files which they import or which they are imported by.

Once you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical check with "fresh eyes" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues, silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and intelligently correct them.

## Exploration Strategy

1. Pick a random entry point (API route, component, utility)
2. Trace imports and exports
3. Understand the data flow
4. Check for issues along the way
5. Fix anything you find

Be sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS.md and ensure that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides referenced in the AGENTS.md file.
