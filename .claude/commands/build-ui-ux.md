# Build UI/UX

I also want you to do a spectacular job building absolutely world-class UI/UX components, with an intense focus on making the most visually appealing, user-friendly, intuitive, slick, polished, "Stripe level" of quality UI/UX possible for this that leverages the good libraries that are already part of the project.

## Quality Standards

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Consistent spacing (use Tailwind spacing scale)
- Thoughtful color usage
- Proper visual hierarchy

### Interaction Design
- Smooth transitions (150-300ms)
- Clear hover/focus states
- Immediate feedback on actions
- Loading states that reduce perceived latency

### Code Quality
- Accessible by default (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Responsive without breakpoint soup
- Reusable and composable
- Well-typed with TypeScript

## For Awake Project

Tech stack:
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS 4
- React 19
- TypeScript strict mode

Follow existing patterns in `src/components/`.
