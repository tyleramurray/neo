# Next Bead

Pick the next bead you can actually do usefully now and start coding on it immediately; communicate what you're working on to your fellow agents and mark beads appropriately as you work.

And respond to any agent mail messages you've received.

## Process

1. Check inbox for messages: (use Agent Mail MCP tools)
2. Respond to any pending messages
3. Check available beads: `bd ready`
4. Pick the highest priority bead you can work on
5. Claim it: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
6. Notify other agents what you're working on
7. Start coding!

## Selection Criteria

When choosing which bead to work on:
- Highest priority first
- Unblock other agents if possible
- Pick something you can complete in this session
- Consider your expertise and context

## Don't Get Stuck

If you're unsure:
- Just pick something and start
- Progress is better than paralysis
- You can always pivot if needed
