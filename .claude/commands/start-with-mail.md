# Start With Mail

Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages.

Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately.

When you're really not sure what to do, pick the next bead that you can usefully work on and get started.

Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names.

## Session Start Workflow

1. **Check Mail** (2-3 min max)
   - Fetch inbox
   - Respond to urgent messages
   - Note any assignments or blockers

2. **Review Beads** (2-3 min)
   - `bd ready` - see available work
   - Check for assigned beads
   - Identify highest priority

3. **Start Working** (rest of session)
   - Claim a bead
   - Notify others
   - Execute
   - Complete and close

## Key Principle

Communication enables coordination, but **shipping code** is the goal. Don't let perfect coordination prevent progress.
