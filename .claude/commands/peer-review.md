# Peer Review

Ok can you now turn your attention to reviewing the code written by your fellow agents and checking for any issues, bugs, errors, problems, inefficiencies, security problems, reliability issues, etc. and carefully diagnose their underlying root causes using first-principle analysis and then fix or revise them if necessary?

Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go super deep!

## Review Focus Areas

1. **Cross-cutting concerns** - Does the code integrate well with the rest of the system?
2. **Consistency** - Does it follow the same patterns as other code?
3. **Dependencies** - Are imports and dependencies correct?
4. **Data flow** - Is data being passed correctly between components?
5. **State management** - Is state being handled properly?

Use thorough analysis. Take your time to understand the code before making changes.
