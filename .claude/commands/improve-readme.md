# Improve README

What else can we put in there to make the README longer and more detailed about what we built, why it's useful, how it works, the algorithms/design principles used, etc.

This is incremental NEW content, not replacement for what is there already.

## Areas to Expand

1. **Project overview**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who is it for?
   - What makes it unique?

2. **Architecture**
   - High-level system diagram
   - Key components and their roles
   - Data flow

3. **Features**
   - Detailed feature descriptions
   - Screenshots or GIFs
   - Use cases

4. **Technical details**
   - Design principles
   - Key algorithms
   - Performance considerations

5. **Getting started**
   - Prerequisites
   - Installation steps
   - Configuration options

6. **Contributing**
   - Development setup
   - Code style guide
   - PR process

## Guidelines

- Add, don't replace
- Keep it readable
- Use clear headings
- Include examples
- Add visuals where helpful
