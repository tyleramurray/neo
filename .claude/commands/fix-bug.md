# Fix Bug

I want you to very carefully diagnose and then fix the root underlying cause of the bugs/errors shown here, but fix them FOR REAL, not a superficial "bandaid" fix!

## Bug Details

$ARGUMENTS

## Diagnostic Process

1. **Reproduce** - Can you reproduce the issue?
2. **Isolate** - What's the minimal code path that triggers it?
3. **Root cause** - What's the actual underlying problem?
4. **Fix** - Address the root cause, not just the symptom
5. **Verify** - Confirm the fix works and doesn't break anything else
6. **Prevent** - Add tests to prevent regression

## First Principles Analysis

- What should this code do?
- What is it actually doing?
- Why is there a difference?
- What's the simplest fix that addresses the root cause?

Don't patch symptoms. Fix the actual problem.
