# Daily Maintenance

Quick forward progress session (ideal for phone via VibeTunnel):

## Workflow (15-30 min)

### 1. Status Check (2 min)
```bash
git status
bd ready
bd stats
```

### 2. Pick One Task (1 min)
- Choose highest-impact ready bead
- Or address any blockers
- Keep scope small

### 3. Execute (10-20 min)
- Claim the bead
- Do focused work
- Stay on task

### 4. Review (2 min)
Run `/fresh-review` on your changes

### 5. Commit & Push (2 min)
Run `/smart-commit`

### 6. Update Status (1 min)
```bash
bd close <id>  # Mark complete
bd sync
git push
```

## Tips for Phone Sessions

- Keep changes small and focused
- Don't start anything you can't finish
- Prefer bug fixes and small improvements
- Save large features for desktop sessions

## Quick Commands

```bash
am                  # Start Agent Mail (if needed)
bd ready           # See available work
bd stats           # Check progress
/fresh-review      # Review your changes
/smart-commit      # Commit and push
```
