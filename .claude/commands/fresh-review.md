# Fresh Review

Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes" looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover.

## Review Checklist

1. **Logic errors** - Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Edge cases** - Are boundary conditions handled?
3. **Error handling** - Are errors caught and handled appropriately?
4. **Type safety** - Are types correct and complete?
5. **Security** - Any potential vulnerabilities?
6. **Performance** - Any obvious inefficiencies?
7. **Code style** - Does it follow project conventions?

Be thorough but practical. Fix issues as you find them.
