# Synthesize Plans

I asked 3 competing LLMs to do the exact same thing and they came up with pretty different plans which you can read below. I want you to REALLY carefully analyze their plans with an open mind and be intellectually honest about what they did that's better than your plan.

Then I want you to come up with the best possible revisions to your plan (you should simply update your existing document for your original plan with the revisions) that artfully and skillfully blends the "best of all worlds" to create a true, ultimate, superior hybrid version of the plan that best achieves our stated goals and will work the best in real-world practice to solve the problems we are facing and our overarching goals while ensuring the extreme success of the enterprise as best as possible.

You should provide me with a complete series of git-diff style changes to your original plan to turn it into the new, enhanced, much longer and detailed plan that integrates the best of all the plans with every good idea included.
