# Complete Docs

Now I need you to look through the existing documentation and look for the (many, many) instances of functionality in our project that are not described or explained at all yet (or explained inadequately), and then create and expand the documentation to cover these in an exhaustive, intuitive, helpful, useful, pragmatic way.

Don't just make a dump of methods, parameters, etc. Add actually well-written narrative explaining what the stuff does, how it is organized, etc. to help another developer understand how it all works so that they can usefully contribute to the system.

## Documentation Audit

1. **Identify gaps**
   - Undocumented features
   - Outdated information
   - Missing examples
   - Unclear explanations

2. **Prioritize**
   - Core functionality first
   - Commonly used features
   - Complex areas that need explanation

3. **Write good docs**
   - Clear, concise language
   - Real examples
   - Explain the "why" not just "what"
   - Keep up to date

## For Awake Project

Key docs to maintain:
- `docs/architecture.md` - System design
- `docs/workflows.md` - n8n workflow documentation
- `docs/decisions.md` - Active patterns (concise)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions
