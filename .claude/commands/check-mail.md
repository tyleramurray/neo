# Check Mail

Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages, and also acknowledge any contact requests; make sure you know the names of all active agents using the MCP Agent Mail system.

## Process

1. Use Agent Mail MCP tools to fetch inbox
2. Review each message
3. Respond to questions or requests
4. Acknowledge work assignments
5. Note any file reservations
6. Update your understanding of who's working on what

## Response Guidelines

- **Questions**: Answer promptly and clearly
- **Work assignments**: Acknowledge and confirm or discuss
- **Status updates**: Note for your awareness
- **Blockers**: Offer help if you can
- **File reservations**: Respect and note them

## Don't Get Stuck

- Check mail regularly but don't obsess
- Respond within reasonable time
- If no urgent messages, get back to work
- Communication supports work, not replaces it
